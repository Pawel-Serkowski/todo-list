I created this project to learn about useReducer. I used useRef hook too. It took me 3 days (evenings), and I've done it with step-by-step plan.

Plan:
1. evening - simple framework by html and css. (container for todos, todo tile, color pallete)
2. evening - more functionality and styling to (input and button to submit todo with functionality, buttons "create" and "delete", relesing  useReducer)
3. evening - end of the project (buttons functionality, semantic correction, complete useReducer function)

Enjoy :)
